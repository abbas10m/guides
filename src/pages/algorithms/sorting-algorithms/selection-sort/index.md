## Selection Sort

* Selection Sort is a simple sorting technique that divides the list into two groups â€“ Sorted and Unsorted. 
* After each pass, the element with the least value(in the unsorted group) is found and swapped with the first element in the unsorted group.
* If there are n elements in the list, a total of (n-1) passes are required to sort the list completely.

#### Example : Acsending Order

Below is the original list/array in unsorted order.

At 1st pass, the least element (8) is swapped with the first element (23)

At 2nd pass, the least element in the unsorted list (23) is swapped with the first element in the unsorted group (78)

At 3rd pass, the least element in the unsorted list (32) is swapped with the first element in the unsorted group (45)

At 4th pass, the least element in the unsorted list (45) is swapped with the first element in the unsorted group (78)

At 5th pass, the least element in the unsorted list (56) is swapped with the first element in the unsorted group (78)

After the 5th pass, the list is sorted in acsending order.

 In the example ablove, 
 * `n = 6` as there are 6 data elements (23, 78, 45, 8, 32, 56)
 * It was completely sorted in `(n-1) = 5` passes
